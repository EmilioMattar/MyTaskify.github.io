# Taskify
## Project duration: 
6 months, from February 2023 to August 2023
## Project description: 
Developed as part of the "Development of Internet-based systems" course in 2023, Taskify is a user-friendly web application that empowers individuals to efficiently manage their daily tasks and to-do lists. With a robust MySQL database backend, Taskify offers features like user registration, login, password recovery, and task creation. Its intuitive interface allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks seamlessly.
## Project Features:
1. User Registration and Login: Users can register with a unique email and password, and existing users can securely log in to access their tasks.
2. Password Recovery: Forgot your password? Taskify has you covered! Users can initiate a password recovery process and receive a secure link to reset their password.
3. Task Lists: Create and manage multiple task lists, where each list can have a title and a list of users with access to it.
4. Task Management: Within each task list, users can add and delete tasks. Tasks include a title, creation date, and responsible user information.
5. Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed, and a visual indicator appears to distinguish completed tasks from pending ones.
6. Responsive Design: Taskify is designed to adapt seamlessly across various devices, providing a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.
7. Database Integration: The application utilizes a MySQL database to store user information, task lists, and tasks, ensuring data is securely managed.
8. User Input Validation: All forms in Taskify include comprehensive user input validation, ensuring data integrity and reducing errors.
9. Access Control: Unauthorized access is prevented, and non-logged-in users are automatically redirected to the login page for enhanced security.
10. Bootstrap Framework: Taskify employs the Bootstrap framework to enhance the application's overall visual appeal and improve user interface components.
11. AJAX Interactions: Task addition and deletion are performed seamlessly using AJAX, enhancing the user experience without page refreshes.
12. Demo Users: The project includes predefined demo users with sample data to demonstrate the application's functionality during testing and evaluation.
13. Exportable Database: The MySQL database is provided in the project repository, enabling easy setup and testing for interested collaborators.
